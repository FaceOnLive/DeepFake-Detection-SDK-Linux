Is your ID Verification Solution secure against DeepFake Attacks?

Test yourself with #deepfake photos from https://generated.photos and https://thispersondoesnotexist.com.


A Russian hacker called "White Usanka" has created videos showing how he can exploit weaknesses in Liveness and Remote ID Proofing software using free or very low-cost methods. (Check youtube videos here: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteUshanka1)

He spoofed well-known ID Verification Software from iProov, BioID, Sum & Substance, Shufti Pro (2021), and Innovatrics (2022) using DeepFake photos from https://generated.photos


We #faceonlive developed a robust #deepfake detection solution and integrated it into our on-premise liveness solution.
